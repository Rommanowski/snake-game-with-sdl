# Snake Game

## Description

This project is a classic Snake game.

Players can start a new game at any time by pressing 'n' or exit the game immediately by pressing Esc.
The elapsed time, points, and current snake length are displayed on the screen, providing transparency about the game's functionality.


## Features

- **Basic Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Self-Collision Detection**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
- **Edge Collision Handling**: The snake turns automatically to avoid crossing the board edges.
- **Blue Dot**: Eating the blue dot makes the snake grow longer.
- **Speedup**: The game speeds up after a fixed time interval.
- **Red Dot Bonus**: Eating the red dot grants a random bonus (shorten the snake or slow down its movement).
- **Points System**: Earn points by eating blue and red dots.
- **New Game and Exit**: Start a new game with 'n' or exit with Esc.
- **Easy to be modified**: Most of the games attributes can be changed by changing constants in file "constants.h" (f.e initial size, speed, window width etc.)
